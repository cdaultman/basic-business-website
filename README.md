// Name //
Caleb Aultman

// Project Description //
A basic business website made to practice using HTML, CSS, and other foundational Software Development technologies.

// How to Use //
Start up a live server an open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice. Make use of the navbar buttons to access different pages.

// Technologies Used //
I made use of HTML and CSS to create the basic structure and formatting as well as bootstrap for some more advanced elements.

// Ideas for Future Improvement //
My biggest idea to potentially improve the site would be to do some formatting changes to make the site more mobile friendly. I know bootstrap has formatting tools that would allow this, so in the future, I would like to do the necessary format changes. I would also like to add more functionality to the menu page, most notably the ability to "place orders" and generally interact with the page.
