Caleb Aultman

// Project Description //
A basic business website made to practice using HTML, CSS, and other foundational Software Development technologies.

// How to Use //
Start up a live server an open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice. Make use of the navbar buttons to access different pages.

// Technologies Used //
I made use of HTML and CSS to create the basic structure and formatting as well as bootstrap for some more advanced elements.

// Ideas for Future Improvement //
My biggest idea to potentially improve the site would be to do some formatting changes to make the site more mobile friendly. I know bootstrap has formatting tools that would allow this, so in the future, I would like to do the necessary format changes. I would also like to add more functionality to the menu page, most notably the ability to "place orders" and generally interact with the page. I would also like to see how else I could format the page to improve it aesthetically. While I don't dislike the direction I went in this regard, I still feel like the website turned out a little bit bland, something I would very much like to change.

// User Stories //
-As a customer, I would like a contact form so I can contact the owners as needed.
-As a customer, I would like a menu page so I can view the options provided by the store.
-As a store owner, I would like a home page so I can introduce potential customers to the store.
